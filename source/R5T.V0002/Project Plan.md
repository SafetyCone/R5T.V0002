# R5T.V0002
Test fixtures for common functionalities (like path operations and day of week operations).


## How this library works

This library contains test fixtures and test articles for common operators, like those found in the R5T.L0066 repository.
However, because these test fixtures and test articles are of general use, they are not *just* for the operators of the R5T.L0066 library, but for any library that might be interested in testing an IPathOperator instance, for example.
